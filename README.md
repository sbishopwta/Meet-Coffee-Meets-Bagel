# Meet the Coffee Meets Bagel team

This project was built using Xcode version 8.2.1 (8C1002). Written in Swift 3. Built for iOS 10.0.

### Design and Development
There are a few `TODO`s left commented in this codebase. This is to show thoughts I had while building this given the time constraint. One day I may write unit tests and deal with error handling for this appâ€¦ but today is not that day.
>Please keep in mind, we anticipate most candidates to spend about ~3 hours on this project, although of course time allocation is totally up to you.

After research, design, and development, this project took somewhere between 8 and 10 hours.

### Third Party

Thanks for checking this out! Hope you enjoy -

>Your task is to create a "Meet the Team" iOS application (using the attached team.json file) allowing the user to browse and learn about the Coffee Meets Bagel team.  How you accomplish this task and what information you display is entirely up to you.  Your submission will be judged on code quality, creativity, and the final product. Remember, we want to see how you work as a coder and app designer! Extra points for clean code, and creativity :)

>Please keep in mind, we anticipate most candidates to spend about ~3 hours on this project, although of course time allocation is totally up to you. We have interviewed previous candidates for surprisingly simplistic designs, just as frequently as for amazingly complex designs. Just make sure your code is clean, and the finished product is something you'd feel comfortable submitting to a manager or supervisor.
